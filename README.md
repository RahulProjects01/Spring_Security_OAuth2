# Spring Security OAuth2 Integration

This application demonstrates **OAuth2** authentication and authorization using **Spring Security**, allowing users to securely log in with their third-party accounts (such as Google, GitHub, or Facebook). The app implements **OAuth2** to protect resources and manage user access based on their identity.

## Features
- **OAuth2 Authentication**: Provides third-party login functionality using providers like **Google**, **GitHub**, and others.
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Integrates with **Spring Security** to restrict access to resources based on the authenticated userâ€™s roles.
- **Secure Access to Resources**: Protects sensitive endpoints and services with OAuth2-based security, ensuring that only authenticated users can access certain resources.
- **JWT Integration**: OAuth2 authentication can be combined with JWT tokens to securely maintain session state and authorize users.

## Tech Stack
- **Backend**: Spring Boot, Spring Security, OAuth2, JWT
- **OAuth2 Providers**: Google, GitHub, or any other OAuth2 provider (customizable)
- **Database**: MySQL (to store user data and session tokens)
- **Tools**: Postman (for API testing), IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse (for development)
